# DS4400_Final_Project

## Running our Code
The ipynb file contains a cell that will create a csv file which the rest of our machine learning tasks will use, called devanagari_df.csv. This csv is not included in this repository because it is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. 

In order to run our file, please start by running the first two cells and generating this csv file. From there, the rest of the code will run properly. The resulting dataframe should be 92000 rows and 1025 columns.
